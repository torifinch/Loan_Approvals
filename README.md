# Loan Approval Prediction with Machine Learning
Predicting Loan Status with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost

## üîç Overview

This project applies machine learning to predict loan approval outcomes based on applicant details. Using a publicly available dataset, we explore data cleaning, feature engineering, class balancing with SMOTE, and model evaluation to identify the most effective approach for accurate predictions.

---

## üìÅ Dataset Summary

The dataset includes variables like:
- **Applicant and Coapplicant Income**
- **Loan Amount & Term**
- **Credit History**
- **Dependents, Marital Status, Education**
- **Target**: `loan_status` (1 = approved, 0 = denied)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing Workflow

| Step               | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Missing Values   | Imputed using mean/mode or flagged with missingness indicators              |
| Feature Engineering | Created `total_income`, `loan_to_income`, and `is_family`                     |
| Encoding         | Applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables                          |
| Scaling          | StandardScaler used prior to PCA and logistic regression                    |
| Class Balancing  | SMOTE applied to address class imbalance in the training dataset            |

## Model Performance

###  Logistic Regression (Baseline)
- **Accuracy**: 0.83  
- Weak at identifying rejected loans (Recall = 0.33 for class 0)

###  Random Forest (Tuned with GridSearchCV)
- **Accuracy**: 0.84  
- Strong, balanced performance  
- **Best performing model overall**

###  XGBoost (Tuned with GridSearchCV)
- **Accuracy**: 0.82  
- Competitive, but slightly lower than Random Forest

##  Key Takeaways

- SMOTE significantly improved performance on the minority class.
- Random Forest offered the best balance of precision and recall.
- Custom engineered features like `loan_to_income` were highly predictive.

---

##  Future Directions

- Investigate fairness and bias across demographic features like gender and employment type.
- Experiment with other ensemble algorithms (e.g., LightGBM, CatBoost).
- Use SHAP values for explainable AI and model transparency.
